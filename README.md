# hello-world

Went to "archetecture week" at AWS loft in new york city last week, and was completely blown away by two things:
1) I knew abuot 85% of what they were talking about.
2) How cloud/microsystem architechture is the present and future of development/operations.

Now I just need someone to give me a job in devops or a jr. development position.

I definitely would love to work of Amazon Web Services.

And now I'm here.
