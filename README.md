# hello-world

Went to "archetecture week" at AWS loft in new york city last week, and was completely blown away by two things:
1) I knew about 85% of what they were talking about; I've been teaching myself python and linux for the six monthy and was surprised at home much I actually do know.

2) How cloud/microsystem architechture is the present and future of development/operations.

Now I just need someone to give me a job in devops or a jr. development position.

I definitely would love to work of Amazon Web Services.

And now I'm here. Selah.
